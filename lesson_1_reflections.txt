How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file
help you see the bug that was introduced?
This is my first time using Git. It's so complicated,
but I think over time it will become second-nature.
The end. Diff does the hard work for me so that I can
focus on the things that matter more.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file
make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
If I have the entire history of a file, I can edit forth with less
worry. I can take more drastic revisions, and dial back if I traversed
too far.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to 
create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically 
saved, like Google docs does?
If I forget, I forget the changes too. That responsibility requires
diligence.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one 
commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Git is for holistic coding and revisioning.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
I can slowly compare and contrast files. SLOWLY.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break 
something?
I don't have to worry too much about losing previous versions, and I don't have to worry about finding what went wrong manually.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I want to use git to make endless amounts of money... And great programs.
