When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I'd like to use a remote repository whenever I'm stationed at an online computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up
-to-date with your remote repository?
It's a collaborative environment, so maybe I wouldn't want to draw all the branches immediately before I review them.
