When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I'd like to use a remote repository whenever I'm stationed at an online computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up
-to-date with your remote repository?
It's a collaborative environment, so maybe I wouldn't want to draw all the branches 
immediately before I review them.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks be all like, I clone on the github yo. Clones be the OG clones. Like attack of d'clones. Branches split yo work up into chewable bites so that you can experiment.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
I benefit from working on the latest revision of a project.
